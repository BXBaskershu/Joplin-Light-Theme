# Joplin-Light-Theme


A light theme for those find it dazzling looking at white background.

This theme is far from completed yet, but posted here in case if everyone is interested.

This theme is modified from [Joplin Clear UI theme](https://github.com/marcteys/joplin-theme-clearUI) by [Marc Teyssier](https://github.com/marcteys).

For installation, follow the custom css guide on [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) and replace the corresponding code in 'userstyle.css' and 'userchrome.css'.
